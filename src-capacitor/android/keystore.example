# Example keystore file
# This file should be replaced with your actual keystore file (guest-spot-key.jks)
# 
# To generate a new keystore file, use the following command:
# keytool -genkey -v -keystore guest-spot-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias guest-spot-alias
#
# Make sure to:
# 1. Replace this file with your actual keystore
# 2. Update the passwords in local.properties
# 3. Never commit the actual keystore file to version control
